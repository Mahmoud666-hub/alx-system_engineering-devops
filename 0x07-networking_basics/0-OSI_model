The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)
model is a conceptual framework that defines how computers communicate with each other over a network.
It consists of seven layers, each with its own specific function and set of protocols.
The Physical Layer
The Data Link Layer
The Network Layer
The Transport Layer
The Session Layer
The Presentation Layer
The Application Layer

Starting from the bottom,
the first layer is the physical layer,
which deals with the physical aspects of transmitting data such as cables,
The second layer is the data link layer,
which is responsible for establishing and maintaining communication
between two devices on the same network.
The third layer is the network layer,
which handles the routing of data between networks.
The fourth layer is the transport layer,
which ensures reliable transmission of data between two devices.
The fifth layer is the session layer,
which establishes and manages sessions between applications.
The sixth layer is the presentation layer,
which deals with the syntax and semantics of the data being transmitted.
the seventh layer is the application layer,
which provides services to applications for network communication.
